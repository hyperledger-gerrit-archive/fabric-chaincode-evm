# Hyperledger Fabric EVM chaincode plugin

This is the project for the Hyperledger Fabric chaincode plugin for the
Burrow EVM. At its essence, this project enables one to use the Hyperledger
Fabric permissioned blockchain platform to interact with Ethereum smart
contracts written in an EVM compatible language such as Solidity or Viper.

The first phase of this project delivers the chaincode plugin. This chaincode
plugin integrates the Hyperledger Burrow EVM package in a Go chaincode shim
and maps the various methods between the peer and the EVM itself.

The second phase, which should deliver around the time of the Hyperledger fabric
1.3 release in September, 2018 will add a Fabric proxy that implements an
Ethereum compliant JSON RPC interfaces, so that users could use tools, such as
Remix, Truffle, etc, to interact with smart contract running in the Fabric EVM.

We hang out on the
[#fabric-evm channel](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/fabric-evm). We are
always interested in feedback and for help in development and testing! See the
[Fabric's CONTRIBUTING documentation](http://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/CONTRIBUTING.html)
for information on how to contribute to this repository.

## Design Document

Please see the design document in [FAB-6590](https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-6590).

## Deploying the Fabric EVM Chaincode

This chaincode can be deployed like any other user chaincode to Hyperledger
Fabric. The chaincode has no instantiation arguments.

You can run the end-2-end test in which a sample Fabric Network is run and the
chaincode is installed with the CCID: `evmcc`
```
make integration-test
```
The end-2-end test is derivative of the hyperledger/fabric/examples/e2e_cli test. You can compare them to see what is
different.

To interact with the EVM (deploying a contract, executing transactions against
that contract), you will need to leverage one of the Fabric SDKs for the time
being while we continue development of the Web3-Fabric proxy. You can see from
the [e2e_cli/scripts/script.sh](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-chaincode-evm/blob/master/e2e_cli/scripts/script.sh)
script in the end-2-end test how to interact with the EVM chaincode using the
Fabric CLI.

Basically, the interaction is the same as with any other chaincode, except that
the first argument of a chaincode invoke is the address for the contract.
