v0.2.0 Release Notes - April 1, 2019
=====================================

EVM CC
------
- [FAB-13102](https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-13102) &
  [FAB-14213](https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-14213) - Burrow EVM
dependency was updated. The update introduces support for the opcodes
`STATICCALL`, `SHL`, `SHR`, `SAR`, `RETURNDATASIZE`, `RETURNDATACOPY` and
completed support for `REVERT`. Smart contracts can be compiled using compilers
of version 0.5.
**NOTE** The `BLOCKHASH` opcode is not implemented and will result in a panic during
execution.

**NOTE** The new version of the EVMCC is not compatible with v0.1.0 and
therefore the chaincode cannot be upgraded to 0.2.0.

Fab3
----
- [FAB-13384](https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-13384) - All references to
FabProxy have been updated to Fab3. This change affects the configuration
environment variables as well. `FAB3_ORG`, `FAB3_USER`, `FAB3_CHANNEL`,
`FAB3_CCID`, & `FAB3_PORT`. For more details about how to use the environment
variables look at the [instructions](../README.md#running-fab3)
to run Fab3.

- [FAB-13385](https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-13385) - Fab3 can be
configured using flags instead of environment variables. If both flags and
environment variables are given, flag values will override the corresponding
environment variables. As part of this change, the chaincode id is no longer
required and will default to `evmcc` if nothing is provided. The environment
variable used to change the listenting port for fab3 has been changed to
`FAB3_PORT.` For more information about the flags and environment variables look
at the [instructions](../README.md#running-fab3) to run Fab3.

- [FAB-13585](https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-13585) - Fab3 now supports
`eth_blockNumber`. The method will return the number of the latest block on the
chain in the configured channel.

- [FAB-13630](https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-13630),
  [FAB-14020](https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-14020),
  [FAB-14021](https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-14021), &
  [FAB-14092](https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-14092) - Fab3 now supports
`eth_getLogs`. The method allows queries along a block range for logs, queries
with a blockhash, filtering based on originating contract addresses, and
filtering based on the event log topics.

**NOTE** Due to the breaking changes involved in updating the EVMCC, v0.2.0
version of Fab3 is not compatible with v0.1.0 of the EVMCC.

Fixes
-----
The blockhash that was previously being returned by Fab3 in
`eth_getTransactionReceipt`, `eth_Transaction`, `eth_getBlockByNumber` was
incorrect. As part of [FAB-14092](https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-14092),
the blockhash returned are now correct and will correspond with the Fabric
Network.
