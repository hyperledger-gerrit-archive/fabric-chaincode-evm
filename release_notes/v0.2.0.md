v0.2.0 Release Notes - April 1, 2019
=====================================

EVM CC
------
- [FAB-13102](https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-13102) & [FAB-14213](https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-14213) - Burrow EVM dependency was updated.
The update introduces support for the opcodes `STATICCALL`, `SHL`, `SHR`, `SAR`,
`RETURNDATASIZE`, `RETURNDATACOPY` and completed support for `REVERT`. Smart
contracts can be compiled using compilers of version 0.5.
**NOTE** The `BLOCKHASH` opcode is not implemented and will result in a panic during
execution.

Fab3
----
- [FAB-13384](https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-13384) - All references to
FabProxy have been updated to Fab3. This change affects the configuration
environment variables as well. `$FAB3_ORG`, `$FAB3_USER`, `$FAB3_CHANNEL`,
`$FAB3_CCID`, & `$FAB3_PORT`. For more details about how to use the environment
variables look at the [instructions](../README.md#running-fab3)
to run Fab3.

- [FAB-13385](https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-13385) - Fab3 can be
configured using flags instead of environment variables. If both flags and
environment variables are given, flag values will be used. As part of this
change, the chaincode id is no longer required and will default to `evmcc` if
nothing is provided. The environment variable used to change the listenting port
for fab3 has been changed to `FAB3_PORT.` For more information about the flags
and environment variables look at the [instructions](../README.md#running-fab3)
to run Fab3.

- [FAB-13585](https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-13585) - Fab3 now supports
`eth_blockNumber`. The method will return the number of the latest block on the
chain in the configured channel.

- [FAB-13630](https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-13630) - Fab3 has limited
support for `eth_getLogs`. The method allows queries along a block range for
logs and the ability to filter based on originating contract address. Subsequent
releases will contain support for topic filters.
